Maintenance
===========

List of changes that need to be done for maintenance reasons.
Those affect the extension itself, not users of the extension.

E.g. changes once we drop a certain TYPO3 version.
We might have new code backported for compatibility in older TYPO3 versions.
Those changes are documented so we know what to do once we drop an older version.
