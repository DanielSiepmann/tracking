* Exclude tables from reference index.

  The tables can grow very fast depending on the number of visiting.
  Also some installations keep the records for a long time.
  That would make it nearly impossible to properly update the reference index.
  Therefore the extension now excludes their tables by default.

  One can prevent this, by removing the event listener e.g. via custom `Services.*`
  files.
