Fixes
-----

* Improve performance of widgets with large datasets

  A new database index is added which is used by widget queries.
  This can reduce the calculation time of database based on dataset.
  One concrete project reduced from > 5 seconds to below 0.2 seconds.

  This mainly improves the PageviewsPerPage widget.

  PageviewsPerDay is fixed by altering the whole query to fetch all data in a
  performant way.
  A single query with native group by date is issued, instead of a single query per
  day.

  Resolves: :issue:`63`.
