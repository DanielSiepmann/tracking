2.0.0
=====

Breaking
--------

* No longer has ``operating_system`` database column.

* No longer ships default rule to not track requests from bots.
  Does track them as bots now.

  How to update:

  Remove custom adjustments from :file:`Services.yaml` regarding bot detection.
  Instead extend built in bot extraction and adjust custom widgets to exclude those
  bots.

  Execute the provided command (scheduler task) to update existing data.
  Bots and operating system will be extracted from stored user agent.

  See: :ref:`tags`.

* Existing widgets will no longer work with custom configuration.
  Configuration needs to be adjusted.

  .. todo:: document how to migrate

* Widgets will not work with old data.
  How to migrate data:

  Execute the provided scheduler task.
  It will incrementally update pageviews and recordviews.
  3500 records of each will be updated per each run.
  Roughly executing every 10 minutes seems to be a good idea.

Features
--------

* Added support for tags

  Tags can now be added to :ref:`pageview` and :ref:`recordview`.
  The extension ships with some out of the box, but further can be added, see
  :ref:`tags`.

  Resolves: :issue:`46`.
