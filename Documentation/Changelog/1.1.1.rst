Fixes
-----

* Allow copy of pages

  Pages can not be copied by administrators as DataHandler will copy all
  pages, including tx_tracking_* tables.
  Those are not allowed on tables which will result in error messages.

  A test is added to simulate the action and ensure it doesn't fail with
  errors.

  Resolves: :issue:`52`.

Tasks
-----

* Mark extension as stable within extension manager

  This extension is already stable.
  It is used since a year in multiple production systems.
  Don't provide a bad feeling to integrators and users.

* Add missing changelog for 1.1.0

* Always use TestCase of testing framework

  That way the framework can add extra logic like cleanup.
  We don't have to worry about such things.

* Switch to ECS for coding style

  This allows configuration via PHP.
  It also combines code sniffer and php cs fixer.

* Remove --no-suggest from CI

  This is no longer supported by composer V2.
